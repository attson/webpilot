 * claim any session id or working directory it liked. `sessionId` and `label`
 * are therefore carried for display and management only.
 *
 * What this protects against is a local process silently taking control of the
 * browser. What it cannot protect against is a process that can read
 * `~/.atwebpilot/` — which could already do considerably worse.
