/**
 * Side-panel entry point for the meta-plane tools (closeTab / switchToTab /
 * searchBookmarks / searchHistory / downloadImage / downloadSpreadsheet).
 *
 * The implementations live in `background/bg-tools/*` and are shared with the
 * coordinator / MCP `EXEC` path through `meta-tool-router`. Before Plan 32 they
 * lived here, which meant an external agent could not reach them at all. This
 * module now only supplies the side panel's notion of which tabs are in scope.
